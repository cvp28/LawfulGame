Each new profile (i.e. Konym) can only play on one story when created
To play a different installed story, the user must create a new profile

This helps ensure that directory and file clutter is cut-down and easily organized by forcing each user save directory to contain exactly one Computers.xml file

Folder Structure Example:

	Content
		Saves
			Konym
				User.xml
				Computers.xml
			Other
				User.xml
				Computers.xml

		Story
			Lawful
				Story.xml
				Computers.xml

			Other
				Story.xml
				Computers.xml
