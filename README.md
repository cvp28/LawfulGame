## Official repository of the Lawful text-based adventure hacking game

Repository contains everything needed to run the game in it's current state.  
The main project is "Lawful", which contains the .sln file needed to open it in Visual Studio.  
  
Lawful is not setup to run on other people's computers yet. A small change in Lawful.Program.Initialize() in Program.cs is needed for that.  
Instructions are provided in the code comments.
